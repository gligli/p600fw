xnor midi is a library written by Alex Norman.

This project used to be called avr-midi but it should be useful for other C
projects.

It is licenced with the GPL v3 licence, see the file "COPYING" for more info.
If you'd like to use this library in a non GPL compatible project, write me an
email and we can discuss alternatively licensing and payment.

Please send me bug info, bug fixes, general improvements, etc.  alex at x37v.info
