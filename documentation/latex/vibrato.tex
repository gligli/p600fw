With the upgrade the Prophet 600 features a dedicated pitch vibrato as part of the patch. Its parameters are available in the additional patch parameter menu as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \textbf{(2) Vibrato Speed} sets the vibrato frequency in a range of approximately 1/20 to 60 Hz
  \item The \textbf{(3) Vibrato Amount} sete the vibrato strength
\end{itemize}

The vibrato shape is a triangle wave. As part of the patch parameters, the vibrato effect can be also be controlled by either the modulation wheel or a delay function. The additional patch parameter \textbf{(44) Modulation Wheel Target} can be set to \textit{vibrato} or \textit{LFO}. When set to \textit{vibrato}, pushing the modulation wheel up adds vibrato strength. The strength of the modulation wheel is controlled by the additional patch parameter \textbf{(33) Modulation Wheel Range}. If the modulation wheel target is set to \textit{LFO}, on the other hand, the modulation delay is automatically applied to the vibrato, e.g. the vibrato onset is delayed by the amount set by the additional patch parameter \textbf{(4) Modulation Delay}. For setting the parameters of the modulation wheel see section \ref{modwheel}.
