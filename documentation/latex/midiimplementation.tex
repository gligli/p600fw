Two types of MIDI events are implemented in the ,upgraded Prophet-600:

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
  \item MIDI CC Continuous parameters: value resolution of 0-16383 using 2 CCs (fine and coarse), or value resolution of 0-127 using only the coarse one
  \item MIDI CC Stepped parameters: 0-127, variable number of steps. They work by dividing the 0-127 range in as many zones as there are choices for the parameter. E.g.: "Unison" is an on-off parameter and therefore has s choices. In this case it is \textit{off} for 0-63 and it is \textbf{on} for 64-127.
  \item Performance events (note events, pitch bend)
  \item Real time events
  \item SysEx (for different purposes)
\end{itemize}

The Prophet-600 receives Continuous Controllers (CC) in \presetmode only.

\textbf{Change in MIDI CC from version 2.1 RC3 to \version}

The following MIDI CC have been changed.

\begin{itemize}
  \item For the filter envelope release and decay and the 2nd envelope release and decay the time value range has been rescaled for the \textit{linear} envelope shape. This was an unavoidable side effect of changing the strictly linear shapes to linear shapes with soft tails. The exponential envelopes are unaffected.
  \item The \lfofreq has been totally rescaled. The stepped frequency range parameter has been omitted and the value range of the \lfofreq dial now covers the entire frequency range. However, the dial to frequency relation has also been changed from linear to exponential, making it much softer at low settings. Consequently, the MIDI CC support for the LFO frequency range (up to firmware version 2.1 RC3) has been omitted. In order to avoid potential conflicts with MIDI tools developed for firmware versions 2.0 and 2.1 RC3, the legacy MIDI CC 58 has not been re-designated. MIDI CC 58 is ignored.
  \item The value to frequency relation for the \vibspeed has been changed from linear to exponential.   
  \item The \modwheelrange has been reconfigured with new value which also produce different wheel actions.
\end{itemize}
