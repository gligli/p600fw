The upgraded Prophet 600 offers a conitnuous parameter per patch to introduce deliberate variations in voice tuning and envelope times (both envelopes) in  order to emulate imperfections of hardware implementations. The additional patch parameter \textbf{(888) Spread} ranges from 0 (no variations) to 99 (strongest variation). The tuning differences between the voices is less pronounced than using unision detune. The variations in envelope times are relative, e.g. the variations are smaller at shorter times. At full spread the differences in attach and release can be significant, especially at longer times. The sustain levels of the two envelopes are not changed, e.g. they are the same for all voices. Note that in unison mode, the spread is applied in addition to the detune (if activated). 

Note that \textbf{Spread} is implemented as an additional patch parameter and this parameter replaces the former spread switch in the miscellaneous settings menu which from version XXX has been omitted.
