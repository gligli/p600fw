The upgraded Prophet-600 offers a continuous parameter to introduce deliberate variations in voice tuning and envelope times (both envelopes) in  order to emulate imperfections of hardware implementations. This menu parameter \vintage ranges from 0 (no variations) to 99 (strongest variation). The variations in envelope times are relative, e.g. the variations are smaller at shorter times. At full spread the differences in attack and release can be significant, especially at longer times. The sustain levels of the two envelopes are not changed, e.g. they are the same for all voices. Note that in unison mode, the spread is applied in addition to the detune (if activated). The tuning differences introduced using \vintage are generally less pronounced than unison detune.

Note that \vintage is implemented as a menu parameter. This \underline{patch} parameter replaces the former spread switch in the miscellaneous settings menu, which has been omitted in version \version.
