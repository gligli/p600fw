The Prophet 600 can be started in maintenance mode by shortening "TP301 SCALE" and powering up. 

In this mode the display shows the current oscillator/filter (A1..A6,B1..B6,F1..F6) and a value that needs to be made close or equal to zero by tweaking the corresponding adjustable.

Press 1 to go to next oscillator/filter, press 2 to go the previous one.

When done, turn off the synth and unshort TP301, next start will be in normal mode.
