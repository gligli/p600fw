In preset mode or live mode the current sound is stored by pressing the \textbf{Record} button, whose LED starts flashing, and then entering the (two-digit) target patch number on the \textbf{Number Pad}. Once the second digit is entered the patch is stored automatically and the LED of the Record button deactivates.   

Loading patches is done by entering the preset mode and then selecting the patch on the number pad.
