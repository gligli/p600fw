The firmware stores the following data:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Application code: starting at page pointer 0
  \item Settings: 2 pages starting at page pointers 476 and 477 
  \item 100 patches: 100 pages starting at page pointer 256
  \item Current panel patch data: one page at page pointer 475
  \item Sequencer data (track 1 and 2): 1 page each at pointers 456 (track 1) and 457 (track 2)
\end{itemize}

The data is written into application part of the storage, into the RWW (read-while-write) section of the memory. The number of pages used a firmward version can be obtained by counting the pages contained in the SysEx file.

Note to developers: the application code must fit into the first 256 pages (up to and including page pointer 255). This corresponds to a SysEx size of 85258 kB which is the equivalent of 65536 kB hex file. Code beyond this size will overwrite patches and will be corrupted by patch storage operations.
