For supporting the integration of the Prophet 600 in a MIDI setting, e.g. using SysEx, integration in DAW setup or simply attaching an external controller, the MIDI send and receive channels can be set using dedicated miscellaneous settings as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
  \item Setting number 1: pushing key "1" repeatedly while holding down From Tape cycles through the MIDI receive channels, from \textit{OMNI} through channels \textit{Ch1} to \textit{Ch16}
  \item Setting number 2: pushing key "2" repeatedly while holding down From Tape cycles through the MIDI send channels, from \textit{Ch1} to \textit{Ch16}
\end{enumerate}

The Prophet 600 supports a \textit{local off} mode which is toggled using the setting "7". In \textit{local off} the following internal events are not executed in the Prophet 600 but are still sent as MIDI events. The typical setup would be to connect to a MIDI recorder and feed the MIDI messages back to the instrument. The \textit{local off} mode ensures that there is no doubling of events.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
  \item Key on, key off
  \item Pitch Bender
  \item Modulation Wheel
  \item Hold Pedal
\end{enumerate}

Note that program changes are sent via MIDI but are executed in the Prophet 600 also in \textit{local off} mode. The Prophet 600 accept and executes program change MIDI messages only in \textit{preset mode}.
