For supporting the integration of the Prophet 600 in a MIDI setting, e.g. using SysEx, integration in DAW setup or simply attaching an external controller, the MIDI send and receive channels can be set using dedicated miscellaneous settings as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
  \item Setting number 1: pushing key "1" repeatedly while holding down From Tape cycles through the MIDI receive channels, from \textit{OMNI} through channels \textit{Ch1} to \textit{Ch16}
  \item Setting number 2: pushing key "2" repeatedly while holding down From Tape cycles through the MIDI send channels, from \textit{Ch1} to \textit{Ch16}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Local on/off mode}
