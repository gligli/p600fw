The mix of the two VCOs is routed through a resonant 24db low pass filter (built on a Curtis CEM3372 filter). The control for the filter consists of a \filtercutoff dial regulating the cut-off frequency, and a \filterres dial for the resonance. The \filterenv dial regulates how strongly the cut-off frequency is modulated by the filter envelope. This dial is bipolar, e.g. it supports positive and negatives values (effectively an inverse envelope setting). The display will show values between -50 and 50 depending on position. This is major enhancement compared to the original Prophet 600 firmware.

The \keyboardtrack switch has the setting \textit{Off}, \textit{1/2} and \textit{Full}. It lifts the cut-off frequency depending on keyboard note, e.g. the cut-off frequency is higher for higher notes. The effect applies to the cut-off frequency resulting from the fixed \filtercutoff setting plus any envelope and LFO modulation, e.g. it applies to the sum.
