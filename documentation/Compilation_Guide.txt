This document describes compile setup and procedures.

Generall, the compilation requires
1. AVR Tools
2. Python

Linux
-----

Use the package installation command specific to your Linux distribution to install the following packages:
- git
- gcc
- avr-libc
- avr-gcc
- avrdude
- binutils
- python2 (until the rewrite of the fw2syx script Python 2.x is needed)

Use git to clone the repository locally. Then, from  the bash command line navigate inside the /firmware folder and execute 'make'.

Windows 
-------

Note: the following is from original instructions - unchanged since May 2015 and potentially outdated.

1. Download [MHV_AVR_Tools_20121007]
2. Download [python-2.7.8.amd64.msi]
3. install [MHV_AVR_Tools_20121007] to "C:/MHV_AVR_TOOLS"
4. Install [python-2.7.8.amd64.msi] to "C:/Python27"

5.Set path to "C:/MHV_AVR_TOOLS" and "C:/python-27"
 e.g. windows7
    1. open control panel>system>Advanced system settings
         will open [system property] window
    2.select [Advanced] tab > [Environment Variables..]
         will open [Environment Variables] window.
    3.[System Variables] colum, select [Path] variable > Edit
    4. Add ";C:/MHV_AVR_Tools/lib;C:/MHV_AVR_Tools/bin;C:/Python27"
    
6.Exec " MHV AVR Shell" 
7.Now you stay "C:/users/yourname>". move to the source code directry.
  e.g. if you put source code in "d:/dev/p600fw"
  		C:/users/yourname>d:[enter]
  		d:/>cd /dev/p600fw/firmware[enter]
  		d:/dev/p600fw/firmware>
  
  	and last step to compile
  		d:/dev/p600fw/firmware>make[enter]
  		
  	you will get "p600firmware.hex" and "p600firmware.syx"
  
  8.if you got  error  like as "[sizebefore] error"
  	edit Makefile in firmware directry as follow as,.
  		LINE 423>all: begin gccversion sizebefore build sizeafter end
  		to	
  		LINE 423>all: begin gccversion  build  end
  
  Good luck and Enjoy!
