Description
===========

This is the P600FW project, a CPU/firmware remake for the SCI Prophet 600 (http://www.vintagesynth.com/sci/p600.php).
It uses a slightly modified Teensy++ board (http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp_pins.html) that plugs into the Z80 socket.

Installation and usage
======================

See documentation...

Compiling the Firmware
======================

Requirements:
- AVR-GCC cross-compiler (e.g. on Windows: "MHV_AVR_Tools_20121007", on Mac: "CrossPack for AVR")
- "Teensy Loader" for flashing the compiled firmware to the physical device (http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html)

> cd firmware
> make

This will produce p600firmware.hex, which you can flash onto your Teensy++ using the Teensy Loader.
For more information about compile procedures, See  documentation/about_Compile.txt.
