This directory contains a `Dockerfile` that you can use to build the 
firmware for your Prophet 600 without having to install anything other
than Docker.

How-To
------

1. Clone this repo to your local system.
2. Install Docker CE; at least version 17.06
3. Follow instructions for your OS below to do the build and obtain the
   firmware file.
4. After completing the build, the file p600firmware.syx in the current
   directory is a SysEx file containing the firmware. Follow the instructions
   in the user guide to install it in your Prophet 600.
